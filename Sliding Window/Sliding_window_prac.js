/*
Write a function which accepts an array of integers and a number called n. The function 
should calculate the maximum sum of n consecutive elements in the array

Get the max sum of any n consecutive numbers in the array.

Ex
maxSubarraySum([1,2,5,2,8,1,5],2) //10

*/

function maxSubarraySum([arr, n]){

/*
O(n^2)
would use a nested for loop
