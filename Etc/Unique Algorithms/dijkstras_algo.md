# Dijkstra's Algorithm
- uses a priority queue as part of solution
- aka Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
    >> Edsger Dijkstra was a physicist turned Dutch programmer
        - Helped to advance the field of computer science from an "art" to an academic discipline
        - Created new disciplines in computer science
            - Many of his discoveries are still used today
## Objectives
### Importance of Dijkstra's 
    >> Lot of algorithms will be built on top of Dijkstra's 
    >> Finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph
        >> what's the fastest way to get from point A to point B
    >> Useful BC
        >> GPS - finding fastest route
        >> Network Routing - finds open shortest path for data
        >> Biology - used to model the spread of vbiruses among humans
        >> Airline Tickets - finding cheapest route to your destination

### Implement weighted graph

- Walk through Dijkstra's
- Implement Dijkstra's using a naive priority queue
- Implement Dijkstra's using a binary heap priority queue
